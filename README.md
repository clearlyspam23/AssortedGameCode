AssortedGameCode
================

This repository is just whatever code I have found myself reusing throughout multiple projects.

You are free to use whatever portion of it you want, for whatever you want.

Some bits of the code may have dependencies on other libraries,
these dependencies will be made clear through package name and comments at the top of the file

I do not guarantee that any of it works
